# sjf_audio


This folder contains a collection of header files comprising classes and functions used within my plugins. 
There are a variety of DSP and interface objects as well as some utility functions.

Uses the [Juce](https://juce.com/) framework.
sjf_fftConvo uses [Apple's Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate) (so is currently MacOS only)
Some of the classes also use the [gcem compile time math library](https://github.com/kthohr/gcem)

...The organisation and some of the code needs some improvement and some of the files just need to be removed...
